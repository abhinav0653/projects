From statistics are obtained by running case1.sh it is observed that
1)Computationally intensive prog1 spends most of the time in user space.
2)File I/O intensive prog4 spends most of the time in system space.
3)Program only outputting to console using printfs(prog2) has a very high waiting time.
4)Program with light computation and heavy console output has intermediate characteristics.



When program are run simultaenously the significant observations are
1)Waiting time increases from 50% to 85%-90% for all the programs. It shows increased competition for a cpu by each of the processes.
2)The system and user space time spent by each process is almost in same ratio as when run sequentially.
3)Due to fair scheduling, both CPU bound and I/O bound process get fair chance.
4)However, if the I/O device is slow(as in case of console),the waiting time of process increases as seen in case of prog2 and prog3.
